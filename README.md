## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Insert 5 LEDs into the breadboard.  
2. Connect a **220Ω resistor** from each ESP32 GPIO pin to the **anode (+)** leg of the LED.  
3. Connect all LED **cathodes (–)** together to the **GND rail** on the breadboard.  
4. Connect the breadboard **GND rail** to an ESP32 **GND pin**.  
5. Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB and upload the provided sketch using Arduino IDE.  
6. Watch the LEDs blink in a colorful sequence.
